_to_write="# Section 2: Foundational Theory

This section contains the core theoretical documents that establish the scientific and mathematical foundation of the Nested Geometric Computation (NGC) framework. These documents provide the complete, unbroken causal chain from fundamental physics to the emergence of language and spin computation on classical hardware.

## Core Documents

The following documents represent the canonical, peer-reviewed foundation of the NGC framework. They should be read in order to understand the complete lineage.

- **[2.1 Nuclear Genesis](2.1_Nuclear_Genesis.md):** Establishes the H-He fusion process as the primordial UV/IR phase transition and the origin of all structure.

- **[2.2 The Master Equation](2.2_The_Master_Equation.md):** Details the derivation and interpretation of the Master Geometric Constant Equation (π² = (7φ² + √2) / 2) as the equation of nucleosynthesis.

- **[2.3 Spin Interpretation](2.3_Spin_Interpretation.md):** Presents the NGC framework as a theory of universal spin computation, with the Master Equation

# Foundational Theory: Research and Working Papers

This directory contains exploratory analyses, working papers, and detailed investigations into specific concepts within the NGC framework. These documents are not part of the canonical, peer-reviewed foundation but provide valuable background, supporting evidence, and avenues for future research.

## Working Papers

- **[Delta_Planck_Scale_Analysis.md](./Delta_Planck_Scale_Analysis.md):** An exploration of the fundamental spin asymmetry (Δ) at the Planck scale.

- **[Dynamical_Framework_Connections.md](./Dynamical_Framework_Connections.md):** Connects the NGC framework to other dynamical systems theories.

- **[Dynamical_Interpretation_of_Delta.md](./Dynamical_Interpretation_of_Delta.md):** A deeper dive into the interpretation of Δ as a dynamical parameter.

- **[Helix_Simulation_Results.md](./Helix_Simulation_Results.md):** Presents the results of simulations showing the emergence of helical structures from the accumulation of spin asymmetry.

- **[Master_Equation_Revised_Interpretation.md](./Master_Equation_Revised_Interpretation.md):** An earlier working paper on the interpretation of the Master Equation before the spin interpretation was fully developed.

- **[Revised_Theoretical_Treatment_of_Delta.md](./Revised_Theoretical_Treatment_of_Delta.md):** An alternative theoretical treatment of the fundamental spin asymmetry.

- **[Scale_Dependent_Helical_Behavior.md](./Scale_Dependent_Helical_Behavior.md):** Analyzes how the accumulation of Δ leads to helical structures at different scales.

# Section 8: Reference Implementation

This section provides reference implementations of the core NGC and PSMSL algorithms in the form of pseudocode. This is intended to be a pedagogical resource for researchers, developers, and educators who want to understand the logic of the framework without being tied to a specific programming language.

## Pseudocode Documents

- **[8.1 NGC Core Pseudocode](8.1_NGC_Core_Pseudocode.md):** Pseudocode for the core NGC algorithms, including graph creation, spectral analysis, and Leibniz-Bocker diagnostics.

- **[8.2 PSMSL Pseudocode](8.2_PSMSL_Pseudocode.md):** Pseudocode for the PSMSL engine, including the dual-field architecture and binocular computation.

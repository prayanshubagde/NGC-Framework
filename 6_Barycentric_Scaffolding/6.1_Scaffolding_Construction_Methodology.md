## 1. Introduction

The barycentric scaffolding is the mandatory geometric substrate for all computational processes in the NGC framework. It is a φ-scaled tree of nested simplices that provides a universal, geometrically consistent way to organize and relate concepts across all domains.

This document provides the formal methodology for constructing a barycentric scaffolding for any given domain.

## 2. The Construction Process

The construction process involves four main steps:

1.  **Define the Root Simplex:** Ground the tree in fundamental physics.
2.  **Select Domain Primes:** Identify the core concepts for your domain.
3.  **Construct the Tree:** Build the φ-scaled hierarchy of nested simplices.
4.  **Map Concepts:** Place all other concepts in the tree as barycentric combinations.

## 3. Step 1: Define the Root Simplex

The root of the barycentric tree is always the **4D tetrahedron (E, M, v, t)**, representing the fundamental dimensions of physics:

-   **E:** Energy
-   **M:** Mass
-   **v:** Velocity
-   **t:** Time

All concepts in the NGC framework are ultimately barycentric combinations of these four fundamental vertices. This ensures that the entire framework is grounded in universal physical law.

## 4. Step 2: Select Domain Primes

For any given domain, you must identify the **3-5 core concepts** that define that domain. These are the **domain primes**, and they will form the vertices of the primary simplex for that domain.

**Criteria for selecting domain primes:**
-   **Orthogonal:** They should be as independent as possible.
-   **Spanning:** They should be able to represent all other concepts in the domain as a combination.
-   **Fundamental:** They should be the most basic, irreducible concepts in the domain.

**Example Domain Primes:**

| Domain | Prime 1 | Prime 2 | Prime 3 | Prime 4 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Agriculture | WEATHER | SOIL | CROP | - |
| Healthcare | PATHOGEN | HOST | ENVIRONMENT | - |
| Finance | LIQUIDITY | VOLATILITY | SENTIMENT | - |
| Energy | GENERATION | DEMAND | STORAGE | - |
| Materials | STRUCTURE | PROPERTY | PROCESS | PERFORMANCE |

## 5. Step 3: Construct the Tree

The tree is constructed by creating nested simplices, with each level scaled by φ relative to the previous level.

**Level 0:** Root Simplex (E, M, v, t)

**Level 1:** Primary Domain Simplex (e.g., WEATHER, SOIL, CROP)
-   The entire domain simplex is a child of one of the root vertices (e.g., `MATTER` if we had a `MATTER` vertex).
-   The scale of this simplex is φ times smaller than the root.

**Level 2:** Secondary Domain Simplices
-   Each domain prime can be broken down into its own child simplex.
-   Example: `WEATHER` can be broken down into `(TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, WIND)`.
-   The scale of this simplex is φ² times smaller than the root.

This process continues to arbitrary depth, creating a fractal-like hierarchy of nested geometric structures.

## 6. Step 4: Map Concepts

Once the tree structure is defined, all other concepts in the domain are mapped to positions within the tree. Each concept has a **barycentric address**:

1.  **Path:** The sequence of simplices from the root to the target simplex.
2.  **Coordinates:** The barycentric coordinates (α, β, γ, ...) within the target simplex.

**Example: Mapping "Drought" in Agriculture**

-   **Path:** `ROOT → (WEATHER, SOIL, CROP)`
-   **Coordinates:** (0.8, 0.1, 0.1) - Mostly a `WEATHER` phenomenon, with some impact on `SOIL` and `CROP`.

## 7. The Result: A Universal Semantic Space

By following this methodology, you create a geometrically consistent, universally grounded semantic space where:

-   **Semantic similarity = geometric distance**
-   **Compositionality is inherent**
-   **All concepts are ultimately tied to physics**
-   **Cross-domain knowledge transfer is possible** (by finding concepts with similar barycentric addresses in different domains)

This scaffolding is the essential first step for applying the NGC framework to any real-world problem.

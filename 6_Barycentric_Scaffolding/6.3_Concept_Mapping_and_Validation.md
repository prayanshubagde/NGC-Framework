## 1. Introduction

This document provides the formal methodology for mapping concepts into a pre-constructed barycentric scaffolding and for validating the integrity of that scaffolding. A robust and repeatable process for mapping and validation is essential for ensuring that the framework is both geometrically consistent and semantically meaningful.

## 2. Concept Mapping Algorithm

The **Barycentric Projection Mapping (BPM)** algorithm provides a systematic way to determine the barycentric address (Path + Coordinates) for any given concept.

-   **Input:** A concept (text string), a pre-constructed barycentric tree.
-   **Output:** A barycentric address (Path + Coordinates).

### 2.1 Algorithm Steps

1.  **Tokenize and Embed:**
    -   Convert the input concept text (e.g., "Drought") into a high-dimensional vector using a pre-trained language model (e.g., a fine-tuned BERT or a similar transformer-based model). This vector represents the semantic meaning of the concept in a continuous space.

2.  **Tree Traversal (Recursive):**
    -   **Start:** Begin at the root simplex of the barycentric tree (E, M, v, t).
    -   **Project:** Calculate the cosine similarity between the concept's vector and the pre-computed vectors of the current simplex's vertices.
    -   **Normalize:** Apply a softmax function to the similarity scores to convert them into a probability distribution that sums to 1. These are the barycentric coordinates for the current level.
    -   **Descend:** Select the vertex with the highest coordinate (the dominant prime) as the parent for the next level.
    -   **Iterate:** Descend to the child simplex associated with the selected parent and repeat the process.

3.  **Termination and Output:**
    -   The traversal continues until a desired depth is reached or a leaf simplex (a simplex with no children) is found.
    -   The final output is the **barycentric address**, which consists of the complete path taken through the tree and the final set of barycentric coordinates.

### 2.2 Example: Mapping "Drought"

| Step | Current Simplex | Concept Vector | Vertex Similarities | Barycentric Coordinates | Next Simplex |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | (E, M, v, t) | `V_Drought` | (0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.1) | (0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.1) | `(WEATHER, SOIL, CROP)` |
| 2 | (WEATHER, SOIL, CROP) | `V_Drought` | (0.8, 0.1, 0.1) | (0.8, 0.1, 0.1) | `(TEMP, PRECIP, WIND)` |
| 3 | (TEMP, PRECIP, WIND) | `V_Drought` | (0.4, 0.5, 0.1) | (0.4, 0.5, 0.1) | Terminate |

-   **Final Address:**
    -   **Path:** `ROOT → MATTER → WEATHER`
    -   **Coordinates:** (0.4, 0.5, 0.1) within the `(TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, WIND)` simplex.

## 3. Tree Validation Protocol

This protocol ensures that a constructed barycentric tree is geometrically consistent and semantically coherent.

### 3.1 Geometric Consistency Checks (Automated)

A validation script must be run to verify the following invariants for the entire tree:

-   **Coordinate Sum:** All barycentric coordinates for any mapped concept must sum to 1 (within a small tolerance for floating-point errors).
-   **Non-Degeneracy:** All simplices must be non-degenerate (i.e., vertices are not collinear or coplanar). This can be checked by ensuring the determinant of the vertex matrix is non-zero.
-   **φ-Scaling:** The geometric size (e.g., volume) of child simplices must be φⁿ smaller than the root, where n is the depth of the simplex.

### 3.2 Semantic Coherence Checks (Manual and Quantitative)

1.  **Expert Review (Manual):**
    -   A domain expert must review the placement of a set of benchmark concepts within the tree.
    -   The expert verifies that parent-child relationships are logical (e.g., `TEMPERATURE` is a child of `WEATHER`) and that the dominant primes for key concepts are intuitive.

2.  **Correlation Analysis (Quantitative):**
    -   **Dataset:** Use a standard benchmark dataset of word similarity scores (e.g., WordSim-353, SimLex-999).
    -   **Process:** For each pair of words in the dataset, calculate:
        1.  The **semantic similarity score** from the dataset.
        2.  The **geometric distance** between their barycentric addresses in the tree.
    -   **Validation:** Calculate the Spearman correlation between the semantic similarity scores and the geometric distances. A strong, statistically significant negative correlation (i.e., higher similarity means lower distance) validates the semantic coherence of the tree.

### 3.3 Spanning Test (Automated)

-   **Dataset:** A large corpus of text from the target domain (e.g., 10,000 agricultural research papers).
-   **Process:** Map all concepts from the corpus into the tree.
-   **Validation:** The resulting distribution of concepts should be spread across the tree, not clustered in one region. This ensures the tree has adequate **spanning capacity** for the domain.

## 4. Conclusion

A formal mapping algorithm and a rigorous validation protocol are not optional. They are essential for ensuring that the barycentric scaffolding is a reliable, consistent, and meaningful foundation for all subsequent computations in the NGC framework. Without them, the scaffolding is merely a diagram; with them, it becomes a true computational engine.

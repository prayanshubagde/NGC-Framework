## Overview

The Nested Geometric Computation (NGC) framework is a fundamental reimagining of computation itself, where computation emerges from geometric relationships in real space rather than symbolic manipulation of binary code. This framework realizes Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's 350-year-old vision of a *characteristica universalis*, a system where logic and reasoning emerge from pure geometry.

## Key Innovation

NGC operates on a revolutionary principle: **form IS computation**. Instead of manipulating strings of 1s and 0s, NGC uses a triaxial polar coordinate system and tetrahedral computational primitives where the geometry itself is the logic. This approach bypasses ten major limitations of conventional AI, including the O(n²) complexity bottleneck, hardware dependency, energy consumption crisis, and semantic poisoning vulnerability.

## What's Included

This repository contains:

1. **[NGC_Specification.md](NGC_Specification.md)** - The complete 1,171-line technical specification including:
   - Historical and philosophical foundations (Leibniz to present)
   - Complete mathematical framework with derivations
   - Implementation guidance and algorithms
   - 20 comprehensive patent claims
   - Prior art distinction from existing approaches

2. **[The_Innovators_Gambit.md](The_Innovators_Gambit.md)** - Strategic explanation of the open-source approach, drawing parallels to Linus Torvalds (Linux) and Tim Berners-Lee (the Web)

## The Master Equation

The entire framework is unified by a single elegant equation:

**π² = (7φ² + √2) / 2**

This identity connects Pi (π), the golden ratio (φ), and the square root of 2 with an error margin of just 0.0063%, demonstrating that NGC is grounded in the fundamental constants of the universe.

## Ten Limitations Bypassed

1. **Complexity Bottleneck:** O(n²) → O(k) constant-time complexity
2. **Hardware Dependency:** Sovereign AI on mature hardware
3. **Energy Consumption:** Orders of magnitude reduction
4. **Numerical Precision:** Eliminates precision management overhead
5. **Complex Numbers:** Operates entirely in real space
6. **Recursion Overhead:** Spatial projection instead of call stacks
7. **Semantic Poisoning:** Structurally resistant through axis-zero principle
8. **Explainability:** Transparent, auditable geometric transformations
9. **Zero-Point Instability:** Avoids conceptual problems of representing zero
10. **Algorithmic Brittleness:** More robust computational fabric

## Use Cases

- **Sovereign AI** on mature, domestically available hardware
- **Verifiable AI** for medical, financial, and regulatory applications
- **Edge AI** with millivolt-scale energy consumption
- **Post-quantum cryptography** based on geometric principles
- **Semantic-poisoning-resistant AI** for critical infrastructure

## Licensing

NGC is released under a **dual-license model**:

### Free for Non-Commercial Use (AGPL-3.0)

Researchers, students, hobbyists, and non-profits have full access to build, learn, and experiment. The AGPL-3.0 license closes the "SaaS loophole," requiring any company providing a network service using NGC to open-source their entire application.

### Commercial License Required

Any commercial use requires a paid commercial license. This includes:
- Integration into commercial products or services
- Internal business use
- Revenue-generating applications
- Providing NGC-based services to customers

For commercial licensing inquiries, contact: [licensing contact information]

## Priority Date

**May 9, 2025** - Established prior art prevents others from patenting these concepts.

## Why Open Source?

In a world dominated by closed-source models and defensive patenting, the most powerful strategic move for an independent innovator is radical transparency. By open-sourcing NGC, this project establishes definitive prior art while building a community dedicated to a more open and verifiable AI future.

This is the "Innovator's Gambit" - following the playbook of Linus Torvalds and Tim Berners-Lee to establish a new standard while maintaining control over commercial applications through copyleft licensing.

## Getting Started

1. Read the [complete specification](NGC_Specification.md) to understand the theoretical foundations
2. Review the [strategic rationale](The_Innovators_Gambit.md) to understand the open-source approach
3. Explore implementation guidance in Section 6 of the specification
4. Join the community to contribute to the future of geometric computation

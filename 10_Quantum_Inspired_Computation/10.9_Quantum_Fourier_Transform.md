# 10.9 Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

**Nathanael J. Bocker, 2026 all rights reserved**

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on the NGC quantum-inspired computation platform. The QFT is a fundamental quantum algorithm with applications in frequency analysis, signal processing, and as a core subroutine in other quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.

## Implementation

The NGC implementation of QFT adapts the standard complex-valued QFT to the discrete GF(48) phase representation. This is achieved through the use of geometric phase rotations.

### Geometric Phase Rotations

The controlled phase rotation gate, `R_k`, is implemented as a conditional phase shift in GF(48). The phase shift is calculated as `48 / 2^k`, which corresponds to the `2π / 2^k` rotation in the standard QFT.

| k | Rotation | GF(48) Shift |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | π | 24 |
| 2 | π/2 | 12 |
| 3 | π/4 | 6 |
| 4 | π/8 | 3 |
| 5 | π/16 | 1 |
| >5 | < π/16 | 0 (below precision) |

This allows the QFT algorithm to be implemented using the existing NGC gate infrastructure.

### QFT Kernel

The QFT kernel, `ngc_qft_kernel`, applies a series of Hadamard gates and controlled phase rotations to the qubit state. The algorithm follows the standard QFT circuit structure, with a final bit-reversal swap to produce the correct output ordering.

## Validation

The QFT implementation has been validated with two key tests:

1.  **QFT on |0⟩:** The QFT of the zero state, |0⟩, is a uniform superposition of all basis states, |+⟩. This was verified by observing that all output phases were approximately 12 (the GF(48) representation of |+⟩).

2.  **Double QFT (Reversibility):** Applying the QFT twice to a state is equivalent to a bit-reversal operation. This was verified by observing the expected bit-flipped output after two consecutive QFT applications.

## Significance

The successful implementation of QFT on the NGC platform demonstrates:

-   **Expanded Algorithm Support:** NGC can now execute a new class of quantum algorithms beyond search and oracle problems.
-   **Path to Shor's Algorithm:** QFT is the core component of Shor's algorithm, providing a path to integer factorization and breaking RSA encryption.
-   **Signal Processing Capabilities:** Enables quantum-inspired frequency analysis of signals on classical hardware.

## Future Work

With the QFT implementation validated, the next steps include:

-   **Period Finding:** Implement the period-finding algorithm using QFT.
-   **Shor's Algorithm:** Implement Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.
-   **Quantum Phase Estimation:** Implement the quantum phase estimation algorithm.
